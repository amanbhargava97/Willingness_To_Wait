# Willingness_To_Wait
A model to predict the number of days a customer is willing to wait for a specific SKU
based on historical data that will help companies can better anticipate customer needs
and optimize the shelf space by stocking units for which willingness to wait is low. The model
will eventually help in a companyâ€™s aim to achieve SKU rationalization to avoid losing out on
sales due to lack of inventory on hand. The willingness to wait for a SKU is dependent on
multiple factors like part type, customer requirement and urgency, delivery time to the closest
store, and availability of SKU with competitors in the area. Hence, the analysis needs to be done
at a SKU level for a cluster of stores using survival analysis and regression techniques tracking
the customer drop-off for products as delivery time increases. The support from client regarding
providing of required data and legacy insights has been a key part of our project structure. Based
on these findings, this research presents insights into predicting the time a customer is willing to
wait for a specific SKU using time-series, survival and regression concepts in Python and R.
